# Machine Learning Projects (Python)

This repository contains a collection of **machine learning projects** developed for coursework and self-directed study.

Each project focuses on a specific model, dataset, or experimental question, with an emphasis on **understanding model behavior, trade-offs, and evaluation**, rather than only final accuracy.

Projects are organized into **independent folders**, each with its own notebook and documentation.

## Projects

### Ridge Regression: Closed-form vs SGD
**Folder:** `ridge-regression/`

Comparison of Ridge Regression using:
- a closed-form analytical solution
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Focuses on regularisation, model complexity, and scalability.

### SVM and Voting Classifiers for Medical Diagnosis
**Folder:** `svm-voting-classifier/`

Classification on the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset using:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Soft Voting Classifier ensemble

Focuses on recall-oriented model selection and precision–recall trade-offs.

### Face Classification with Random Forest and PCA
**Folder:** `face-classification-rf-pca/`

Face classification using the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, comparing:
- Random Forest on raw pixel features
- Random Forest with PCA-based dimensionality reduction

Focuses on accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability.

## Notes

Some projects were originally developed for  
**University of Western Australia – CITS5508 Machine Learning** coursework  
and later refactored and extended.

More projects may be added over time.
